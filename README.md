# Arduino-Nano-33-IoT

The Arduino Nano 33 IoT is the easiest and cheapest point of entry to enhance existing devices (and creating new ones) to be part of the IoT and designing pico-network applications. Whether you are looking at building a sensor network connected to your office or home router, or if you want to create a BLE device sending data to a cellphone, the Nano 33 IoT is your one-stop-solution for many of the basic IoT application scenarios. The board's main processor is a low power Arm速 Cortex速-M0 32-bit SAMD21. The WiFi and Bluetooth速 connectivity is performed with a module from u-blox, the NINA-W10, a low power chipset operating in the 2.4GHz range. On top of those, secure communication is ensured through the Microchip速 ECC608 crypto chip. Besides that, you can find a 6 axis IMU, what makes this board perfect for simple vibration alarm systems, pedometers, relative positioning of robots, etc (https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-iot).

This project describe how nano 33 IoT is used to collect accelerometer data (x, y, z) by LSM6DS3 IMU sensor module embedded on dev kit. Connecting to MQTT broker (mosquitto) is very possible to deploy on raspberry pi 4.
